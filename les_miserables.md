# Les Misérables

Les Misérables is a French historical novel by Victor Hugo, first published in 1862, that is considered one of the greatest novels of the 19th century.

## Introduction

The novel begins with the character of Bishop Myriel, a kind and generous man who lives simply despite his wealth. The story then introduces Jean Valjean, a man who has served nineteen years in prison for stealing a loaf of bread to feed his sister's starving children and for several escape attempts.

## Valjean and the Bishop

After being released from prison, Valjean finds that no one will give him shelter because he is an ex-convict. Bishop Myriel takes him in, but Valjean steals the bishop's silver during the night. When the police catch Valjean and bring him back to the bishop, Myriel pretends that he had given the silver to Valjean as a gift. This act of mercy transforms Valjean, who decides to become an honest man.

## Montreuil-sur-Mer

Valjean breaks his parole and moves to the town of Montreuil-sur-Mer under the name Monsieur Madeleine. He becomes a successful factory owner and is eventually appointed mayor of the town. Meanwhile, the police inspector Javert becomes suspicious of the mayor's true identity.

## Fantine's Story

Fantine, a young woman who was abandoned by her lover, leaves her daughter Cosette with an innkeeper and his wife, the Thénardiers, and goes to work in Valjean's factory. When the other workers discover she has an illegitimate child, she is fired. She becomes increasingly desperate and eventually turns to prostitution to pay for Cosette's care.

## The Confrontation

Valjean discovers Fantine's situation when Javert arrests her for attacking a bourgeois who had harassed her. Valjean orders her release and promises to bring Cosette to her. Meanwhile, Javert has discovered Valjean's true identity and attempts to arrest him. Valjean escapes and goes to retrieve Cosette from the Thénardiers.

## The Thénardiers

The Thénardiers have been exploiting and abusing Cosette while spoiling their own daughters, Éponine and Azelma. Valjean pays the Thénardiers to let him take Cosette, and they flee to Paris.

## The Convent Years

To escape Javert, Valjean and Cosette take refuge in a convent where Valjean works as a gardener and Cosette is educated. They stay there for several years until Cosette becomes a young woman.

## Marius and the Friends of the ABC

The story then introduces Marius Pontmercy, a young law student who lives in the same building as Valjean and Cosette after they leave the convent. Marius is a member of a revolutionary group called the Friends of the ABC, led by Enjolras. The group plans to start an uprising against the government.

## The Encounter

Marius sees Cosette in the Luxembourg Gardens and falls in love with her. He eventually discovers where she lives and begins to secretly meet with her in the garden of her house. Valjean becomes aware of their meetings and, fearing losing Cosette, plans to take her to England.

## The Robbery Attempt

Thénardier, now living in poverty in Paris, attempts to rob Valjean with his gang. Marius overhears the plot and alerts the police. Javert arrives to arrest the gang, but Valjean escapes before Javert can recognize him. During this incident, Marius also encounters Éponine, who has fallen in love with him.

## The Barricade

The 1832 June Rebellion breaks out, and the Friends of the ABC build a barricade. Marius joins them after learning that Cosette is being taken away. Éponine, disguised as a boy, also joins the barricade to be near Marius. She is fatally shot and dies in Marius's arms after confessing her love for him.

## Valjean at the Barricade

Valjean goes to the barricade to protect Marius for Cosette's sake. He captures Javert, who had infiltrated the revolutionaries as a spy, but instead of killing him, Valjean sets him free. As the barricade falls, Valjean carries the wounded Marius through the sewers of Paris to safety.

## The Sewers and Javert's End

In the sewers, Valjean encounters Thénardier, who is hiding there. Thénardier doesn't recognize Valjean and allows him to pass after robbing him. When Valjean emerges from the sewers with Marius, he is confronted by Javert. Valjean asks for time to bring Marius to his grandfather, and Javert allows it. This act of mercy conflicts with Javert's rigid worldview, and after letting Valjean go, Javert commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine.

## Recovery and Marriage

Marius recovers from his wounds under the care of his grandfather, Monsieur Gillenormand. He and Cosette are reunited and eventually marry. Valjean reveals his past to Marius, who is initially horrified and asks Valjean to stay away from Cosette. Valjean complies and begins to waste away from grief.

## The Revelation

Thénardier, attempting to blackmail Marius, inadvertently reveals that Valjean had saved Marius's life at the barricade. Marius and Cosette rush to Valjean's side, but it is too late. Valjean is dying. He gives Cosette a letter explaining his life story, and dies peacefully, having fulfilled his promise to be an honest man.
