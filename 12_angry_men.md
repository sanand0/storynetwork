# 12 Angry Men

12 Angry Men is a 1957 American courtroom drama film that follows a jury's deliberations in a murder trial.

## The Setup

The film begins in a New York City courthouse where the jury has just heard the final arguments in a murder case. A young man from a slum is accused of stabbing his father to death. The Judge instructs the 12 jurors that they must reach a unanimous verdict of "guilty" or "not guilty," and that a reasonable doubt is sufficient to acquit. If found guilty, the defendant will receive the death penalty.

## Initial Vote

The 12 jurors retire to the jury room on a hot summer day. The Foreman (Juror 1) calls for an initial vote. Eleven jurors vote "guilty," while only Juror 8 votes "not guilty." Juror 8 explains that he doesn't know whether the defendant is guilty or not, but that it's not easy for him to send a boy to his death without discussing it first.

## Examining the Evidence: The Knife

The jurors begin to discuss the case. The murder weapon was a switchblade knife that was identical to one the defendant had purchased. Juror 8 surprises everyone by producing an identical knife that he had bought in a pawn shop near the defendant's neighborhood, undermining the prosecution's claim that the knife was unique.

## Examining the Evidence: The Old Man's Testimony

The jurors discuss the testimony of an old man who lived downstairs from the murder scene. He claimed to have heard the defendant yell "I'm going to kill you" followed by the body hitting the floor, and to have seen the defendant running down the stairs. Juror 9 points out that the old man had marks on his nose from eyeglasses, but didn't wear them in court, suggesting his eyesight was poor.

## Examining the Evidence: The El Train

The old man also testified that he heard the murder through the open windows of his apartment while an elevated train was passing by. Juror 8 times how long it would take the old man to get from his bed to the door to see the defendant running, and concludes that the old man couldn't have reached his door in time given his physical condition.

## Examining the Evidence: The Woman's Testimony

The jurors then discuss the testimony of a woman across the street who claimed to have seen the murder through the windows of a passing elevated train. Juror 8 questions whether she could have seen the killing clearly through the windows of a passing train at night, especially since she wasn't wearing her glasses in bed.

## Second Vote

After these discussions, Juror 8 calls for another vote, but this time by secret ballot. He asks not to vote, saying he'll abstain. If all 11 jurors still vote "guilty," he'll join them and make it unanimous. The result is 10 "guilty" votes and one "not guilty," indicating that someone has changed their mind.

## The Reasonable Doubt

Juror 5, who grew up in a slum, changes his vote to "not guilty," offended by Juror 10's prejudiced remarks against slum residents. The jurors continue to examine the evidence, with more of them beginning to have reasonable doubts about the defendant's guilt.

## The Switchblade Technique

Juror 8 challenges Juror 3's assertion that the defendant, who was skilled with switchblades, would have stabbed downward. He demonstrates that someone experienced with switchblades would more likely stab underhanded, not overhead. This contradicts the downward stab wound described in the autopsy.

## The Personal Vendetta

Juror 3, who has a strained relationship with his own son, becomes increasingly hostile as more jurors change their votes to "not guilty." His personal feelings are clearly influencing his judgment about the case.

## Final Votes

As the deliberations continue, more jurors change their votes to "not guilty" based on reasonable doubts about the evidence. Eventually, only Jurors 3 and 10 remain voting "guilty." Juror 10 goes on a bigoted rant, causing most of the other jurors to turn their backs on him. Ashamed, he changes his vote to "not guilty."

## The Resolution

Finally, only Juror 3 remains voting "guilty." After an emotional outburst where he tears up a photo of himself with his son, he realizes his personal feelings have clouded his judgment. He changes his vote to "not guilty," making the verdict unanimous. The defendant is acquitted due to reasonable doubt.

## The Departure

As the jurors leave the courthouse, Juror 8 and Juror 9 exchange names, while the others depart anonymously. The film ends with the jurors going their separate ways, having fulfilled their civic duty by carefully examining the evidence and reaching a just verdict.
