# The Mahabharatha

The Mahabharatha is one of the two major Sanskrit epics of ancient India, the other being the Ramayana.

## The Beginning

The story begins with King Shantanu, who fell in love with Ganga. They married on condition that Shantanu would never question her actions. Ganga drowned seven of their children, and when Shantanu finally questioned her, she revealed that she was freeing these children from a curse. She left Shantanu but gave him their eighth son, Devavrata (later known as Bhishma).

## The Oath of Bhishma

Years later, Shantanu fell in love with Satyavati. Her father refused to let her marry the king unless her future son would be heir to the throne. Devavrata (Bhishma) took a lifelong vow of celibacy to ensure this, earning the name Bhishma ("terrible oath"). Satyavati had two sons, but both died without heirs.

## The Birth of the Kauravas and Pandavas

Satyavati's son Vyasa fathered children with the widows of her dead son: Dhritarashtra (who was blind), Pandu, and Vidura. Dhritarashtra married Gandhari, who blindfolded herself for life to share her husband's experience. They had 100 sons, the Kauravas, led by the eldest, Duryodhana.

Pandu married Kunti and Madri. Due to a curse, Pandu could not father children without dying. Kunti used a boon to call upon gods and gave birth to Yudhishthira (son of Dharma), Bhima (son of Vayu), and Arjuna (son of Indra). Madri bore twins Nakula and Sahadeva (sons of the Ashvins). These five brothers were the Pandavas.

## Rivalry and the Game of Dice

The Pandavas and Kauravas grew up together in Hastinapura, but rivalry developed. Duryodhana was jealous of Bhima's strength and Arjuna's skills. When Yudhishthira became crown prince, Duryodhana and his uncle Shakuni plotted against the Pandavas.

They invited the Pandavas to a game of dice. Shakuni, using loaded dice, won everything from Yudhishthira, including his kingdom, his brothers, himself, and finally their wife Draupadi. When Draupadi was humiliated in court, Bhima vowed to kill Duryodhana and Dushasana. The game was annulled, but a second game was played with exile as the stake, which the Pandavas lost.

## The Exile

The Pandavas spent 12 years in exile in the forest and one year incognito. During this time, Arjuna obtained divine weapons from the gods. In the 13th year, they disguised themselves and lived in King Virata's court.

## Peace Negotiations

After completing their exile, the Pandavas demanded their kingdom back. Krishna went as a peace envoy but Duryodhana refused to give even five villages to the five brothers. War became inevitable.

## The Bhagavad Gita

Before the war, when Arjuna saw his relatives on the opposite side, he was overwhelmed with grief and refused to fight. Krishna, who had become Arjuna's charioteer, delivered the Bhagavad Gita, a philosophical discourse on duty, action, and dharma. Krishna revealed his divine form to Arjuna and convinced him to fulfill his duty as a warrior.

## The Kurukshetra War

The 18-day war was fought at Kurukshetra. Both sides had mighty warriors. Bhishma led the Kaurava army first, but after 10 days, he was defeated by Arjuna (who used Shikhandi as a shield, knowing Bhishma would not attack Shikhandi, who had been a woman in a previous life).

Drona took command next but was killed through a deception when Yudhishthira announced that "Ashwatthama (Drona's son) is dead" (referring to an elephant with that name). Karna led next but was killed by Arjuna when his chariot wheel got stuck in the mud. Finally, Duryodhana dueled with Bhima and was fatally struck on the thigh (an illegal blow, but revenge for Duryodhana's role in Draupadi's humiliation).

## The Aftermath

After the war, only the Pandavas, Krishna, and a few others survived from the millions who fought. Yudhishthira became king but was filled with remorse over the deaths. After ruling for 36 years, the Pandavas retired to the Himalayas, leaving the kingdom to Arjuna's grandson Parikshit.

## The Ascent to Heaven

On their final journey, the Pandavas and Draupadi set out for Mount Meru to reach heaven in their human forms. One by one, they fell on the journey, with only Yudhishthira and a dog reaching the gates of heaven. When asked to abandon the dog, Yudhishthira refused, showing his righteousness. The dog was revealed to be Dharma (his divine father) in disguise, and Yudhishthira was welcomed to heaven, where he found all his brothers and Draupadi already there.
